# DeFi
This project focuses on building a decentralized finance (DeFi) application on the Ethereum blockchain, using Solidity for smart contract development and Hardhat for deploying and testing the contracts. The application aims to provide secure, transparent, and decentralized financial services Traditional financial systems involve intermediaries, high fees, and slower transaction times. This project eliminates the need for intermediaries by utilizing blockchain technology, offering a secure, transparent, and decentralized alternative. Self-executing contracts were developed to automate and enforce agreements, ensuring transparency and trust.
Asset Management: Enabled users to manage digital assets directly on the blockchain, reducing reliance on centralized institutions.
Peer-to-Peer Transactions: Facilitated direct and secure transactions between users, ensuring privacy and eliminating third-party interference.
